## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM and JavaScript

### What I learned

This exercise was useful for refreshing my ability of working with JavaScript and the DOM instead of using JS in a framework like React. I had to relearn how to grab certain elements and change the HTML, which I haven't done in a while! Also added to my learning of using SCSS

### Continued development

I feel like it can be easy to want to use a framework for every project when that might not be necessary, especially for a smaller project like this one. It can easily be done with the DOM and a bit of JavaScript for all of the functionality. Don't get me wrong, I love frameworks and also find myself wanting to use them for everything big or small, but I think it's also important to re-familiarize yourself with the DOM and some Vanilla JS to undertand the basics!
